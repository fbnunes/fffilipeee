We created a game called Natan Jump, that was an endless runner then adapted into a meme context that happened in Brazil by the same time called \"Run Jessica Run\".\nCatapulted by the reach of the meme, the game also got a lot of attention, being also used as a meme in multiple blogs and social media content in different Facebook pages mainly, and within 3 weeks it reached over 1 million downloads. This was a very interesting happy and learning experience, which then influenced our next career steps.\nWe continued developing other smaller games in the following year (12 in total), 3 other ones reached over 100k downloads, including one partnership with a brazilian youtuber (LipÃ£o Games).\nAs a consequence of that, in 2017 we started working with an Influencer Marketing agency to work with marketing campaigns with internet creators until parting ways and coming back to the development world in 2022, mine specifically, in iOS."

During the university I also participated as a research assistant in some projects, so I was happy on how much I was able to learn overall."

            "text": "In 2012 Brazil had a program called Science Without Borders where students could apply to study in an abroad university if meeting requirements such as GPA and a proven English (at least 80 in TOEFL).\nI was fortunate to be qualified for it and in 2013 I was studying at University of California, Davis (commonly called UC Davis). During that time I was continuing to study Computer Science major and also participating in chairs focused on UI and UX, as well as participating as a research assistant in a C++ project called D.A.N.C.E. that was focused on connecting a 3D model figure to the signals sent by the iPad on the Lemur app (a music software). The final focus was to move the 3D figure as you change the sliders and items in the app (such as sliders), so the final objective was that as the music is being mixed, the figure would be moving with it."
